MY FIRST WEB APP!

This is my first web application. It's a professor review website that allows students at my college to review professors, and look up reviews for classes they may be interested in taking. I wrote this application in Python, using Flask. I made a review class that contains all the necessary information (in app.py) and users fill out a form (home.html) that creates this review object and saves instances of them in a MongoDB. I'm currently hosting the app on heroku, running an instance of the database on the backend through MongoLab. The code is open source so check it out! I used Python, HTML, and CSS, with Flask, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.
